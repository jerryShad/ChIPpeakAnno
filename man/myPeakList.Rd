 ChIP-seq technology (Robertson et al., 2007) 
}
\usage{
data(myPeakList)
}
\format{
  GRanges with slot rownames containing the ID of peak as character, slot start
  containing the start position of the peak, slot end containing the end 
  position of the peak and seqnames containing the chromosome where the peak 
  is located.
